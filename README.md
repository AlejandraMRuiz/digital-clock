## Summary
This was my first project using JavaScript, HTML & CSS.  I always enjoy a good challenge, and coming from knowing next to nothing about programming, this one was quite rewarding for me!  During it, I learnt about everything from how interval functions and event handlers work to page loading idiosyncrasies in JavaScript, to how to interact with the DOM and even what a code smell is!  Overcoming the problems encountered in creating this app was a great start to learning what goes on "under the hood", and I look forward to solving more!
